# Used Car Valuation Project

## Description

This project predicts the selling price of used cars using machine learning. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately predict the selling price of a used car based on various features such as the car's age, mileage, brand, model, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the quikr dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raihansoniwala/quikr-cars. The dataset contains information about used cars listed on the quikr website.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib


## Usage

1. Open the `car_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, train and test the used car valuation model.


## Credits

This project was created by Ayushkumar Yadav as part of my personal project. The used car valuation model was built using the Scikit-learn library.
