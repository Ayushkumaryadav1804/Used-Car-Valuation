# Used Car Valuation Project

## Description

This project predicts the selling price of used cars using machine learning. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately predict the selling price of a used car based on various features such as the car's age, mileage, brand, model, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the CarDekho dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho. The dataset contains information about used cars listed on the CarDekho website.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd repo`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Open the `UsedCarValuation.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, train and test the used car valuation model.
3. To use the trained model to predict the selling price of a used car, run the `predict_car_value.py` script with the desired car details as arguments. For example, `python predict_car_value.py Maruti Suzuki Swift 2016 50000 Petrol Dealer Manual`.

## Credits

This project was created by Jane Doe as part of the Machine Learning course at XYZ University. The used car valuation model was built using the Scikit-learn library.
